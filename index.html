		<H1 id="about">About</H2>
		<p>We are happy to announce that UW will be participating in the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/facebook-open-academy-bringing-open-source-to-cs-curricula/10151806121378920" target="_blank">Facebook Open Academy</a> (<em>a.k.a. <a href="http://www.insidefacebook.com/2013/11/14/class-credit-for-hacking-facebook-expands-open-academy/" target="_blank">Hacking For Credit</a></em>) in Winter/Spring 2014. This class presents a unique opportunity for students interested in a job in industry to gain experience. Facebook has hand-picked important open source projects to which students will contribute, and it has chosen select Facebook engineers who will act as mentors to guide the students through the open source development process.</p>

		<p>In this course, students will work together in teams of ~3. Teams will be matched with open source projects according to student rankings and preferences. (The list of candidate projects will be available on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/openacadamy/" target="_blank">Open Academy Facebook group</a>.) Students will meet weekly with their open source mentors, and will operate using industry-standard development practices and procedures. For example, code contributions from students will be reviewed by their mentors / each other / other project members.</p>

		<p><strong>Instructor</strong>: <a href="http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~dhalperi/">Daniel Halperin</a>. <strong>Email</strong>: <a href="mailto: Daniel Halperin <dhalperi@cs.washington.edu>?subject=CSE495 Programming Practicum">dhalperi@cs.washington.edu</a></p>
		<p><strong>Course Number</strong>: CSE495, Winter/Spring 2014</p>

		<H1 id="requirements">Requirements</H2>
		<H3>Prerequisites</H3>
		<p>Developing quality code for open source projects requires familiarity with computer system design, algorithms, and efficiency. As a result, we ask that applicants have completed <a href="http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse351/" target="_blank">CSE351</a> and <a href="http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse332/" target="_blank">CSE332</a>. Additionally, <a href="http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse331/" target="_blank">CSE331</a> is considered a plus but is not required.</p>

		<H3>Credits and Timing</H3>
		<p>CSE495 will be a 3-credit graded course. As Facebook's program is timed for a spring semester, we will split these three credits evenly across Winter and Spring quarters in 2014. As grades will not be assigned until completion of the program in the Spring, a grade of <a href="http://www.washington.edu/students/gencat/front/Grading_Sys.html#GRADE" target="_blank">'N' (in progress)</a> will be assigned temporarily in the Winter. The undergraduate advisors assure us that this grade will not affect students' academic record.</p>

		<p>The instructor will assign student grades in Spring 2014 after discussion with the open source mentor. Although the mentor will make a recommendation, the instructor will have the final say in grading.</p>

		<H3>Participant expectations</H3>
		<ul>
			<li><p>This course is open to undergraduate students who meet the prerequisites.</p></li>
			<li><p>Students must be enrolled in CSE495 at UW for both Winter and Spring quarters, 2014.</p></li>
			<li><p>Students must be available to travel to Facebook Headquarters during February 7th&ndash;9th, 2014. (This trip will be sponsored by Facebook, so no financial commitment from the student is required.)</p></li>
			<li><p>CSE495 is a graded, three-credit course. We will expect a minimum of approximately 12 hours per week of work from each student on their project during the time, including design, learning practices, programming, code review, meetings, and other course commitments. (Of course, we expect and hope that students will be so happily engaged this expectation will be trivial to meet.)</p></li>
			<li><p>As the goal of this course is to contribute meaningfully to an important open source project, we expect students to learn and adhere to the standards and practices of the project and as suggested by their mentor.</p></li>
		</ul>

		<H1 id="signup">Sign up</H2>
		<p>Students interested in participating in this course, please fill out the following <a href="https://catalyst.uw.edu/webq/survey/dhalperi/219333" target="_blank">Catalyst survey (not yet available)</a>. Unfortunately, we only have room in CSE495 for up to 9 students. Priority will be given to students based on factors including relevant experience, opportunity for personal growth, and course records. That said, we encourage everyone interested to apply (it's a very short survey!). In particular, note that <em>prior experience contributing to open source projects is NOT necessarily required</em>.</p>

		<p>If you have applied but not yet heard from us, please be patient. We expect to send notification emails by <em>December 5th</em>.</p>
